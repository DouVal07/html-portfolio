<h1>About Dou</h1>
<p>My name is Douglas Valencia, my family and friends call me Dou. I´m a huge fan of football, and I really would like to visit a cool stadium</p>

<p>I have learned different skills in my life, I´ve been working in different places since 2016. First, I was working on Dell company, and I work for a 
  retation department, and then I moved to a tech support representative for Alienware computers where I learnt a lot.</p>

<p>My favorite food is Pizza, specially Pizza Hut, I ate it since I was a kid</p>
